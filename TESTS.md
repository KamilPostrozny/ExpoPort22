# TESTS.md — device verification test cases

Written during implementation (T6–T12), executed later in one hardware phase on a physical
iPhone against a real host. Unit tests (`bun test`) already ran at implementation time; this
file holds only what needs a device, a finger, or a live SSH session.

Conventions:
- Case IDs `TX.n` (task, number). Each case: **Setup → Steps → Expect**.
- A case that depends on another task's feature says so inline.
- Tick `[ ]` → `[x]` only on hardware, during the verification phase (T13).

## Cross-task dependency map

How the remaining slices interlock — read before testing, because a failure in one task's
cases can be rooted in its upstream:

- **T6 (scroll)** lives inside the T4 DOM component (`src/terminal.tsx`), where mouse
  protocol / alt-screen / DECCKM state is known. It **exposes those mode signals** over the
  bridge; T11's ribbon consumes them. A T11 ribbon failure on alt-screen detection may be a
  T6 signal bug.
- **T7 (key bar)** implements the **native `TextInput` decision from T4** — keyboard input
  leaves the webview. Dictation filter and held-delete (T12 polish) sit on this input. T7's
  bar is the mount point for T8 (Paste popover, ⋯ menu), T10 (tabs circle, swipe-up), and
  T11 (bar swipe ↔, ribbon above bar).
- **T9 (tmux side-channel)** provides exec-channel helpers (`list-windows`, `capture-pane`,
  `select/kill/new/move-window`), the window badge feed (T7's tabs circle reads it), and the
  foreground-process poll (T11's ribbon reads it). T10 and T11 issue every tmux action
  through T9's helpers — never the attached PTY.
- **T8 (clipboard + uploads)** needs T7's Paste key and ⋯ menu, and T2's SFTP. The
  quick-attach flow is triggered from T11's agent ribbon cap — T8 ships the helper, T11
  wires the cap.
- **T10 (switcher)** needs T9's helpers and T7's tabs button + bar swipe-up hook.
- **T11 (bar swipe + ribbon)** needs T9 (snapshots, poll), T7 (bar), T6 (mode signals),
  T8 (quick-attach helper).
- **T12 (settings + polish)** touches all of the above; its cases re-walk earlier features
  through the Settings door (theme restyle live, tmux toggle hiding T10's tabs button,
  Forget host key moving off the mismatch screen).

Sections below are appended per task, in implementation order.

## T6 — Scroll gesture system

All cases: connected to a real host, terminal on screen. "Notch" = one cell height of finger
travel = one line. Watch the Metro log — the DOM side prints `[terminal] scroll <route> <n>`
per spend and `[terminal] modes {...}` per mode change.

### T6.1 — Plain-shell scrollback pan
- **Setup**: plain shell, `seq 1 200` so there is scrollback.
- **Steps**: pan up one finger slowly; pan back down.
- **Expect**: viewport scrolls locally, ~one line per cell height of travel, content follows
  the finger's direction; log says route `local`; nothing is sent to the PTY (no stray input
  at the prompt).
- [ ]

### T6.2 — `less` scrolls by arrows, both directions
- **Setup**: `less /etc/services` (alt screen, no mouse, no DECCKM).
- **Steps**: pan up (toward earlier lines), then pan down.
- **Expect**: `less` moves line-by-line both ways; log route `arrows`; `less` shows no `ESC O A`
  garbage — bytes are `CSI A`/`CSI B`.
- [ ]

### T6.3 — `htop` with mouse on: wheel at the finger's cell
- **Setup**: `htop` (requests mouse + SGR).
- **Steps**: pan over the process list; then pan while the finger sits over a different column.
- **Expect**: the list scrolls; log route `wheel`; scrolling acts at the row/column under the
  finger (htop scrolls its list regardless, but tmux panes — if attached — scroll the pane
  under the finger, which is the real assertion once tmux is configured).
- [ ]

### T6.4 — DECCKM variant: vim vs less
- **Setup**: `vim` on a long file, `:set mouse=` first so no mouse reporting; separately `less`.
- **Steps**: pan in vim; pan in less.
- **Expect**: vim moves the cursor line-by-line (receives `SS3 A/B` — DECCKM on); less moves
  too (receives `CSI A/B` — DECCKM off). Neither shows literal escape garbage.
- [ ]

### T6.5 — Momentum flick, and a touch stops the coast dead
- **Setup**: plain shell with deep scrollback (`seq 1 2000`).
- **Steps**: flick hard; while it is still coasting, tap the screen once.
- **Expect**: scroll continues after release, decaying smoothly (log `coast start`, then
  `scroll local` lines thinning out); the tap stops it instantly and does nothing else — no
  keyboard raise, no selection, no cursor move.
- [ ]

### T6.6 — One finger and two fingers are the same pan
- **Setup**: plain shell with scrollback.
- **Steps**: pan with one finger; repeat the same travel with two fingers; add a second finger
  mid-pan; lift one of two mid-pan.
- **Expect**: identical scrolling for the same travel; adding/removing a finger neither jumps
  nor re-triggers; no zoom, no selection.
- [ ]

### T6.7 — Stationary long-press still selects (T4 regression)
- **Setup**: plain shell, some text on screen, keyboard down (T4's WebKit focus finding).
- **Steps**: long-press a word without moving; then lift and tap once elsewhere.
- **Expect**: selection appears with the system edit menu (Copy · Look Up …), exactly as T4
  verified; the pan layer never claims the touch (no `scroll` log line); the tap clears it.
- [ ]

### T6.8 — Notch granularity is one line per cell height
- **Setup**: `less /etc/services` with line numbers (`less -N`) so movement is countable.
- **Steps**: pan exactly ~5 cell heights (about 5 rows of text) slowly.
- **Expect**: the view moves ~5 lines, not 1 and not 20; a sub-cell wiggle moves nothing but a
  following pan picks up the carried remainder (no dead zone at slow speeds).
- [ ]

### T6.9 — Mode signal fires on entering and leaving vim
- **Setup**: Metro log visible; plain shell.
- **Steps**: run `vim`, wait for the screen; quit with `:q!`; run `htop`; quit with `q`.
- **Expect**: on vim entry a `[session] modes {"altScreen":true,…,"decckm":true}` line (and its
  `[terminal]` twin from the DOM side); on exit both flags return false; htop entry/exit flips
  `mouseReporting` true/false. One line per change, not one per keystroke.
- [ ]

## T7 — Key bar core

All cases: connected to a real host, terminal on screen, unless said otherwise. The bar's
decisions are unit-tested (`src/keybar-model.test.ts`); these cases are the finger-and-host
half. Stubs in play: Settings is a T12 stub alert (with a working Disconnect), Paste
long-press is a T8 no-op, the tabs badge shows the default `1` until T9's feed, tabs tap and
switcher drag are T10 no-ops, horizontal bar swipe only logs into T11's hook.

### T7.1 — A chord reaches the host: ^C kills a running sleep
- **Setup**: at a shell prompt, run `sleep 100`.
- **Steps**: tap Ctrl (tints accent, chord strip appears), tap the `C · interrupt` cap — or
  tap Ctrl then type `c` on the keyboard.
- **Expect**: `^C` echoes, `sleep` dies, prompt returns; Ctrl disarms (tint gone, strip
  slides away) after the one chord.
- [ ]

### T7.2 — Ctrl double-tap locks and sends repeated chords
- **Setup**: shell prompt with a longish command typed (do the typing *before* locking —
  while locked, every letter chords).
- **Steps**: double-tap Ctrl (<300ms apart) — accentA tint + halo; type `a`, then `e`; tap
  the `C` cap twice; tap Ctrl once.
- **Expect**: while locked every letter chords (`^A`/`^E` jump to start/end of the line) and
  the strip stays up through repeated caps (`^C` twice = two fresh prompts); the single tap
  unlocks (tint + strip gone) and letters type normally again.
- [ ]

### T7.3 — All five strip caps are observable
- **Setup**: shell prompt with some history; then `sleep 100` for Z.
- **Steps**: arm Ctrl before each: `R` → reverse-i-search prompt appears (Esc leaves it);
  `L` → screen clears to one prompt line; with `sleep 100` running, `Z` → `[1]+ Stopped`;
  `C` at an empty prompt → `^C` + fresh prompt; `D` at an empty prompt of a nested shell
  (`bash` first) → the nested shell exits (§7: instant, no confirmation).
- **Expect**: each cap sends its byte once and disarms; captions read interrupt · suspend ·
  history · clear · EOF.
- [ ]

### T7.4 — Esc leaves vim insert mode
- **Setup**: `vim`, press `i`, type a word.
- **Steps**: tap Esc, then type `:q!` + Return (keyboard).
- **Expect**: `-- INSERT --` vanishes on the Esc tap; the `:q!` reaches the command line —
  proof the byte was ESC (0x1b), not text.
- [ ]

### T7.5 — Tab completes in the shell
- **Setup**: shell prompt, type `ls /et`.
- **Steps**: tap Tab.
- **Expect**: completes to `/etc/` (0x09 went down the PTY).
- [ ]

### T7.6 — Paste types the pasteboard
- **Setup**: copy a string on the phone (e.g. from Notes): `echo pasted-ok`.
- **Steps**: tap Paste at a prompt. Then long-press Paste (~420ms).
- **Expect**: the text is *typed* at the prompt, no Return of ours (never executes, §4.4);
  long-press does nothing yet — TODO(T8) clipboard popover.
- [ ]

### T7.7 — Arrows navigate in vim (DECCKM) and walk history at a prompt
- **Setup**: `vim` on a multi-line file; separately a shell with history.
- **Steps**: open the arrows popover (button tints accent), tap ↑ ↓ ← → in vim; quit; at the
  prompt tap ↑ then ↓.
- **Expect**: vim's cursor moves cell by cell (SS3 — DECCKM on, watch `[session] modes`
  say `"decckm":true`); at the prompt ↑/↓ walk shell history (CSI — DECCKM off). Popover
  stays open across taps; outside tap or the button closes it.
- [ ]

### T7.8 — Home/End at a prompt
- **Setup**: shell prompt, type a long command, caret at the end.
- **Steps**: arrows popover → Home, then End.
- **Expect**: caret jumps to line start, then line end (CSI H / CSI F; shells map both).
- [ ]

### T7.9 — Bar swipe ↓ hides the keyboard, ↑ shows it
- **Setup**: keyboard up (it rises on connect).
- **Steps**: swipe down anywhere on the bar; then swipe up on it; then swipe up again with
  the keyboard already up.
- **Expect**: keyboard slides away (bar stays, docked at the bottom, terminal grows —
  `[terminal] size` logs a taller grid); swipe up raises it again; the second ↑ is a no-op
  for now — TODO(T10) switcher drag.
- [ ]

### T7.10 — Keys never fire during a bar swipe
- **Setup**: shell prompt, keyboard up.
- **Steps**: start the ↓ swipe with the finger ON the Esc key; likewise across Ctrl/Tab.
- **Expect**: keyboard hides, but no key fires (nothing at the prompt, Ctrl not armed) —
  the pan activating cancels the press. The press-in dim may flash; the send must not
  happen.
- [ ]

### T7.11 — Press feedback: dim/shrink + haptic on touch, not on echo
- **Setup**: any key; airplane-mode-slow or `sleep`-blocked session is the interesting case.
- **Steps**: press and hold a key; watch and feel.
- **Expect**: the key dims and shrinks while touched and the light haptic fires on the
  *touch*, immediately — even when the session is slow to echo (§4.4: on touch, not echo).
- [ ]

### T7.12 — Two-finger tap opens Settings; two-finger pan still scrolls
- **Setup**: shell with scrollback (`seq 1 200`).
- **Steps**: tap the grid once with two fingers (quick, no movement); then two-finger *pan*.
- **Expect**: the tap opens the Settings stub (T12 alert; `[terminal] two-finger tap` in the
  log) and does not scroll; the pan scrolls exactly as in T6.6 and opens nothing.
- [ ]

### T7.13 — Native input owns the keyboard; selection works with it up (the T4 fix)
- **Setup**: fresh connect (keyboard rises on its own), text on screen.
- **Steps**: type a command — watch it echo; touch the terminal once — keyboard should
  hide; swipe the bar ↑ to bring it back; with the keyboard UP, long-press a word.
- **Expect**: typing reaches the PTY through the native input (webview never focused — no
  webview keyboard flicker); touching the terminal dismisses the keyboard (native default,
  unfought); the long-press selects with the system edit menu even while the keyboard is up
  — the architecture T4 measured for. Backspace and held-delete: single deletes work;
  auto-repeat on hold is TODO(T12).
